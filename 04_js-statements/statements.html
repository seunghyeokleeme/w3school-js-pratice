    <h1>Statements</h1>
    <P>
      JavaScript statements are composed of:<br />
      Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments. <br />
      This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML
      element with id="demo":
    </P>
    <hr />
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <hr />
    <P>
      Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements. The
      statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are
      written.
    </P>
    <mark>
      JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called
      JavaScript code.

      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
